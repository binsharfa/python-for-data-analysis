## Learning Objectives

The objective of this course is to provide students with an experimental approach, through practical experience, with data analysis using the Python programming language. The course is designed to provide students with practical experience with state-of-the-art data analysis tools that are widely used in industry. 
 
This covers will cover the majority of [Python for Data Analysis][6] by Wes McKinney. On completion of this course students should be able to: 

* Recognize and select data types used in Python for data analysis;
* Understand how to prepare data for further analysis using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), and [Seaborn ](https://seaborn.pydata.org) libraries;
* Understand and apply data modelling and analysis workflows in Python; 
* Apply Python for real-world data analysis problems. 

## Lessons

### Module 0

A whirlwind tutorial of the basics of the Python programming language. There module also covers a bit of [IPython](https://ipython.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) related topics sufficient to make learners comfortable with the programming environment prior to tackling the more advanced material presented in later modules. This material should be shared with students prior to the start of the course to review.

## How to teach this course?

To get the most out of this material learners should have completed [Python Crash Course](https://github.com/KAUST-Academy/python-crash-course) prior to attempting this course (but this is not a strict prerequesite). 

Instructors have a few options for teaching the material. 

1. Have the book open on an iPad (or similar); have the students open a new blank notebook; live code some (or all) the examples from the book and use the text of the book as speaking notes.
2. Have the students open the book in their browser; have students open a blank notebook in another browser window and the have them read through relevant chapters of the book and code up the examples. Lead instructor and any teaching assistants are available to troubleshoot and answer individual questions. Common questions should be answered to the group as a live demo.
3. Have the students open the book in their browser; have students open the provided notebooks in another browser window and the have them read through relevant chapters of the book and execute the provided code. Lead instructor and any teaching assistants are available to troubleshoot and answer individual questions. Common questions should be answered to the group as a live demo.
4. Some combination of the above.

Approach 1 is the most difficult for the lead instructor but likely the most engaging for learners; option 3 is easier for both lead instructor and the students but likely results in the least learning. Option 2 is a middle ground: easier for the lead instructor but still requires students to write their own code.
